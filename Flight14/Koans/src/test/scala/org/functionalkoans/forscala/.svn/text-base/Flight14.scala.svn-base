  //
  // "GTAAGCTTAC"

  // ((G),(T,A,-),(A,C),(A),(G,C),(C),(T,-,A),(A),(C))
  // in other words, for these three strings, at each location, list the possibilities that can occur there.
  // We will build this up step by step

  // First, define a method that takes two strings and zips them together
  //
  // if you need help converting a String to a list - have a look at the options in the REPL

  // And now for something completely different
  val numbers = List(10, 3, 21, 7, 9, 13, 15, 10, 16, 2, 1, 8, 12)

  // first up, using what you know, write a method partitionByFirst that takes the first value of a list
  // of Ints, and partitions the rest of the list into two new lists, one with values lower than the first number,
  // and one with the rest. It should return three values, the first number, the list lower, and the remaining list

  // now, using pattern matching, write a method called mysteryFunction that will
  // detect the following cases with the following outcomes:
  // empty list (Nil) => Nil
  // List of Ints => split list into head, lower and remaining using the technique above, then using recursion,
  // return the result of mysteryFunction(lower) ::: List(head) ::: mysteryFunction(remaining)
  // What have you just created? Check that it works in the test below

    newList should be (List(1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 21))
  }

  // Extra credit exercises:
  //
  // Rename the mystery function and it's test with the real name for that algorithm, if you recognize it
  // The choice of the first number as pivot is not a good choice for a list that may already have some kind
  // of sort order, so if you have time, implement a new version that takes a number out of the center of the list
  // and uses that number to partition the rest of the list (without that chosen pivot). Write the function and a
  // suitable test to make sure it still works
  //
  // Going back to the previous example, where you used the foldLeft to create the combination of sequences, try
  // converting to the alternative notation of /: instead. Use the slides or the book for reference
