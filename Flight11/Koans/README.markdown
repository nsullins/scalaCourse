# Functional Koans


### About the Koans

There are several functional languages that have contributed their own
versions of the koans.  Each language has it's own branch with
detailed instructions on how to get started.

### Getting Started

To get the koans for a particular language, simply checkout the
branch:

`git checkout -b <branch_name>`

where <branch_name> is the name of the branch (language) you want to
work on.  To get a list of all branches run:

`git branch -a`
